# Welcome to My Project's Portfolio

Hi, my name is Salomon Marquez. I’m a versatile professional with a career that has evolved across multiple domains. From my early role as a Research Associate in academia to my position as a Senior Technical Writer in the software industry, I’ve embraced diverse challenges and cultivated a broad skill set to adapt to new environments.

With over 10 years of experience in academic writing and 5+ years in technical writing, I’ve developed the ability to translate complex concepts into clear, accessible information for diverse audiences. As a Senior Technical Writer, I’ve taken on roles as a mentor, technical lead, consultant, and open-source contributor, focusing on fostering collaboration with stakeholders and cross-functional teams.

Currently, I’m digging into Machine Learning, with a focus on Bioinformatics. This field connects my technical background with my passion for leveraging data-driven insights to address challenges in health and biology.
